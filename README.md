## Christmas2022
Map of 8th District of Vienna showing when Christmas decorations went up in shop windows. I walked the ~9km to collect the data; the location of each shop was geo-referenced in QGIS. The gif seems to be more suitable for representing the date/time factor. See code for more details.
